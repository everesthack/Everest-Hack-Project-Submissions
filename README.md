### Haggle
--------------------------------------

**Elevator Pitch:**
Pick the better among the bests

**The problem it solves:**
Currently, there is a lack of a common platform for better selection of goods. Because of this reason, users are compelled to find and compare among goods one at a time which is a very tedious task. It's almost impossible to know the best deal when we are surrounded by so many choices and so little time to apprehend them. Haggle is a web-based application designed specifically for readers to provide them a better user experience while shopping. Our application allows users to compare among the many choices without having to step out of their house. It gives user the choices of selecting books by comparing them with the prices from different sellers around their locality. Now, it’s more convenient with all the information on their fingertips. Haggle has two faces: one for the bookshop owner and the other for readers. Our web-app helpsthe bookshop owners to develop their presence in the market and know their competition. Their investment equates to profit at last. For the user, they can compare the best choice among stores quickly and decide to shop by judging on the factors like location, price, student discount, availability etc. provided by our web-app. Since our cloud-based platform provides data of the different stores all at one place, this saves the users valuable time as they don’t need to visit every store to compare the prices or check the availability of their desired book. Our tagline is ‘Pick the better among the best’ and we wish to live by it by providing the users easier access and saving them time, money and energy.
