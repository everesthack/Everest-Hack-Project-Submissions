### Haggle
--------------------------------------

**Elevator Pitch:**
Pick the better among the bests

**The problem it solves:**
Currently, there is a lack of a common platform for better selection of goods. Because of this reason, users are compelled to find and compare among goods one at a time which is a very tedious task. It's almost impossible to know the best deal when we are surrounded by so many choices and so little time to apprehend them. Haggle is a web-based application designed specifically for readers to provide them a better user experience while shopping. Our application allows users to compare among the many choices without having to step out of their house. It gives user the choices of selecting books by comparing them with the prices from different sellers around their locality. Now, it’s more convenient with all the information on their fingertips. Haggle has two faces: one for the bookshop owner and the other for readers. Our web-app helpsthe bookshop owners to develop their presence in the market and know their competition. Their investment equates to profit at last. For the user, they can compare the best choice among stores quickly and decide to shop by judging on the factors like location, price, student discount, availability etc. provided by our web-app. Since our cloud-based platform provides data of the different stores all at one place, this saves the users valuable time as they don’t need to visit every store to compare the prices or check the availability of their desired book. Our tagline is ‘Pick the better among the best’ and we wish to live by it by providing the users easier access and saving them time, money and energy.

### We can See
--------------------------------------

**Elevator Pitch:**
The product will not only allow blind people to detect objects in front of them but also detect pits in front of them.

**The problem it solves:**
Even today where technology rules, blind people rely on sticks or their pets (especially dogs) to walk in the street. It creates inconvenient to walk most of the times with the dog or a stick on their hand. They got hit by stones or small objects while walking on the street and sometimes they fall into pits or ladders. This particular product will help them to walk freely as a normal person does. They don't have to run into a problem of hitting a stone or nearby objects or people or even the pits in front of them.

### BookUp
--------------------------------------

**Elevator Pitch:**
BookUp has the main motto of changing the way we meet people. We are creating a location-based book swapping platform that lets the reader with similar interest to meet and interact with eachother.

**The problem it solves:**
BookUp will mainly tackle three problems: Buying textbooks in colleges is really expensive. Not only this, once those books are bought, the selling process at the end of the semester is complicated. As a result, those books remain as a pile on selves. We provide a unique solution which allows people near you to trade books with you. In this way, we are reducing the cost spent on buying new books. This is a global problem with a TAM of around 6 billion in the US only. There is not a single interactive platform where readers with similar interest can interact and meet. Although some Facebook groups are doing this, but it's not user-specific. Similarly, location is always an issue when you in exchanging books. BookUP solves this problem by providing a location-based interactive platform to swap used books. Most importantly, we want to change the reading culture. Reading has not much been integrated with technology. We want to integrate technology to help people initiate conversation. With BookUp, user haunts for books unlike people for their own benefit in tinder.

### Local Governance
--------------------------------------

**Elevator Pitch:**
Promoting Good Governance.

**The problem it solves:**
There is a lack of effective communication between the government officials who are responsible for formulating plans and policies and the civilians who are supposed to get the benefits. This always causes a conflict between the two parties and casues a lack of faith and trust in the institution since the policies are formulated without understanding the needs of the population. Our app tends to bridges this gap. It informs the civilians about the ongoing project by the gov in their local community so that they can also be a active part of it, and can provide feedbacks and report about it. It promotes local owernship. The officials on the other hand can get real time feedbacks about the project and thus enhances transparency. The locals can inform the officials about their issues on various concerning topics like health,education etc. The officials with the help of this data can know about the real problems that the people are facing and thus develop plans and policies based on data. We can also compare the issues faced by people in different regions with the help of bar graphs, pie-charts and other stats tools can . This helps the government make decisions while allocating budget for different regions. based on real time data. The government bodies can also issue surveys with the help of the application that ease in data collection.

### Ghumna Jaam
--------------------------------------

**Elevator Pitch:**
“Ghumna Jaam” is a Tourist Sharing guide Application which tends to focus on the problem of unemployment and utilizes the opportunity of tourism to create employment among the local guides.

**The problem it solves:**
One of the major problems in our country is unemployment. Since the major problems are caused by small roots, we decided to choose local employment. Local employment can be eradicated by several long-term methods which the 17 Sustainable Development goals fulfill but a current solution to unemployment can be done by using opportunities within the country within the local level of implementation. Since tourism acts as one of the biggest income sources for the country, it can be used to eradicate such local levels of unemployment to some extent. So, “Ghumna Jaam” is an application that tends to solve the problem of unemployment by implementing local guide sharing. It also can be used to solve the problem of frauds and cheaters that tourists have to face which leads to a bad impression upon our country. Also, the experience of Tourists has not been that good while finding good guides for them to hire. “Ghumna Jaam” app resolves all these problems as it has different user interfaces and interaction mechanisms for tourists, guides and support team with live map. The app implements guide hiring system along with feedback and rating system which reduces the chances of frauds and cheaters. Also, a profile system for guides has been made which needs to be verified by Citizenship and Photo so that no frauds or cheaters can register using a fake profile. Also, the cost for hiring the nearest local guide can be viewed and payment can be done from the app so that no hassle has to be made in order to pay the guide. Also, the feedback and rating system causes the guides to work better as the payment will be done based on the last rating of the guide. An emergency button can also be used while the tourist is in danger or needs help which alerts all the nearby guides through SMS which sends the location of the Tourist in danger. Through this, the experience of the guide can be made better which results increase in tourism and also creates employment opportunity for the local guides.

### Health Audit
--------------------------------------

**Elevator Pitch:**
We focus on monitoring basic health service conditions with full transparency,where we can see which projects are lagging behind so that the government bodies get alarmed on what actions to take next.

**The problem it solves:**
* Data Transparency: The main problem with the administration of our country is that the data that are delivered from high level administrations to low level aren't transparent. There is always a blur lines that seperates the high officials who are so called the mayors or reputed posts of the community and the general people like us. A general survey in a municipality has shown that, the high officials always say that they have done the best for their community, but same questions when asked to general public, they tell that they are still stucked in the general base level problems like lack of safe drinking water and power outage. These are the most common problems a typical neplease citizen face.

* continious manual update on data: The trend that has rooted the neplease administration is that once a work is finished then it goes in the trash. It may be used further or not. This problem must be overcomed so that the data are fresh and decisions and actions also reflect present problems and help the decision makers solve them.

* providing insights of actual condition of real life: one of the major problems is that the so called high officials like mayors or prime ministers don't see the problems and challenges in the way the general people see. So, in these cases its our duty to let them see what the problems are clearly in the canvas so that whenever they turn on the screen or use technology, they would see them and that problem would be their first priority and it will help sole these problems in a proper way.

* keep track of survey report: the report once comes as output of any survey must be used and stored for further purposes, they are useful in future references to solve many similar problems. this will help solve time of the analyst as well as the problems solvers.

* Awaring the governmental officials on the projects which they are lagging behind at. the governmental officials always deny without factual data.

### eHealth_Nepal
--------------------------------------

**Elevator Pitch:**
Our project is a web application that connects health institutions and individuals to provide updated health reports.

**The problem it solves:**
In Nepal, we barely have the services of digital health report. Most of the time, we lost our health report and never get it back. If we had our health report in a digitized way, it would not only help us know our health status but also to know future health services we might need. For eg: a hospital could update the vaccines that a patient has taken and also those that are in due. Our platform helps one achieve these goals. Every time, a person goes to the hospital, his online health portal is updated and can be used for easy-sharing, analyzing or for personal use. Overall, we just want to create a digital health diary that we could look upon anytime, anywhere!
