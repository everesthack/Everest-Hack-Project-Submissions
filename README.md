### Haggle
--------------------------------------

**Elevator Pitch:**
Pick the better among the bests

**The problem it solves:**
Currently, there is a lack of a common platform for better selection of goods. Because of this reason, users are compelled to find and compare among goods one at a time which is a very tedious task. It's almost impossible to know the best deal when we are surrounded by so many choices and so little time to apprehend them. Haggle is a web-based application designed specifically for readers to provide them a better user experience while shopping. Our application allows users to compare among the many choices without having to step out of their house. It gives user the choices of selecting books by comparing them with the prices from different sellers around their locality. Now, it’s more convenient with all the information on their fingertips. Haggle has two faces: one for the bookshop owner and the other for readers. Our web-app helpsthe bookshop owners to develop their presence in the market and know their competition. Their investment equates to profit at last. For the user, they can compare the best choice among stores quickly and decide to shop by judging on the factors like location, price, student discount, availability etc. provided by our web-app. Since our cloud-based platform provides data of the different stores all at one place, this saves the users valuable time as they don’t need to visit every store to compare the prices or check the availability of their desired book. Our tagline is ‘Pick the better among the best’ and we wish to live by it by providing the users easier access and saving them time, money and energy.

### We can See
--------------------------------------

**Elevator Pitch:**
The product will not only allow blind people to detect objects in front of them but also detect pits in front of them.

**The problem it solves:**
Even today where technology rules, blind people rely on sticks or their pets (especially dogs) to walk in the street. It creates inconvenient to walk most of the times with the dog or a stick on their hand. They got hit by stones or small objects while walking on the street and sometimes they fall into pits or ladders. This particular product will help them to walk freely as a normal person does. They don't have to run into a problem of hitting a stone or nearby objects or people or even the pits in front of them.

### BookUp
--------------------------------------

**Elevator Pitch:**
BookUp has the main motto of changing the way we meet people. We are creating a location-based book swapping platform that lets the reader with similar interest to meet and interact with eachother.

**The problem it solves:**
BookUp will mainly tackle three problems: Buying textbooks in colleges is really expensive. Not only this, once those books are bought, the selling process at the end of the semester is complicated. As a result, those books remain as a pile on selves. We provide a unique solution which allows people near you to trade books with you. In this way, we are reducing the cost spent on buying new books. This is a global problem with a TAM of around 6 billion in the US only. There is not a single interactive platform where readers with similar interest can interact and meet. Although some Facebook groups are doing this, but it's not user-specific. Similarly, location is always an issue when you in exchanging books. BookUP solves this problem by providing a location-based interactive platform to swap used books. Most importantly, we want to change the reading culture. Reading has not much been integrated with technology. We want to integrate technology to help people initiate conversation. With BookUp, user haunts for books unlike people for their own benefit in tinder.

### Local Governance
--------------------------------------

**Elevator Pitch:**
Promoting Good Governance.

**The problem it solves:**
There is a lack of effective communication between the government officials who are responsible for formulating plans and policies and the civilians who are supposed to get the benefits. This always causes a conflict between the two parties and casues a lack of faith and trust in the institution since the policies are formulated without understanding the needs of the population. Our app tends to bridges this gap. It informs the civilians about the ongoing project by the gov in their local community so that they can also be a active part of it, and can provide feedbacks and report about it. It promotes local owernship. The officials on the other hand can get real time feedbacks about the project and thus enhances transparency. The locals can inform the officials about their issues on various concerning topics like health,education etc. The officials with the help of this data can know about the real problems that the people are facing and thus develop plans and policies based on data. We can also compare the issues faced by people in different regions with the help of bar graphs, pie-charts and other stats tools can . This helps the government make decisions while allocating budget for different regions. based on real time data. The government bodies can also issue surveys with the help of the application that ease in data collection.

### Ghumna Jaam
--------------------------------------

**Elevator Pitch:**
“Ghumna Jaam” is a Tourist Sharing guide Application which tends to focus on the problem of unemployment and utilizes the opportunity of tourism to create employment among the local guides.

**The problem it solves:**
One of the major problems in our country is unemployment. Since the major problems are caused by small roots, we decided to choose local employment. Local employment can be eradicated by several long-term methods which the 17 Sustainable Development goals fulfill but a current solution to unemployment can be done by using opportunities within the country within the local level of implementation. Since tourism acts as one of the biggest income sources for the country, it can be used to eradicate such local levels of unemployment to some extent. So, “Ghumna Jaam” is an application that tends to solve the problem of unemployment by implementing local guide sharing. It also can be used to solve the problem of frauds and cheaters that tourists have to face which leads to a bad impression upon our country. Also, the experience of Tourists has not been that good while finding good guides for them to hire. “Ghumna Jaam” app resolves all these problems as it has different user interfaces and interaction mechanisms for tourists, guides and support team with live map. The app implements guide hiring system along with feedback and rating system which reduces the chances of frauds and cheaters. Also, a profile system for guides has been made which needs to be verified by Citizenship and Photo so that no frauds or cheaters can register using a fake profile. Also, the cost for hiring the nearest local guide can be viewed and payment can be done from the app so that no hassle has to be made in order to pay the guide. Also, the feedback and rating system causes the guides to work better as the payment will be done based on the last rating of the guide. An emergency button can also be used while the tourist is in danger or needs help which alerts all the nearby guides through SMS which sends the location of the Tourist in danger. Through this, the experience of the guide can be made better which results increase in tourism and also creates employment opportunity for the local guides.

### Health Audit
--------------------------------------

**Elevator Pitch:**
We focus on monitoring basic health service conditions with full transparency,where we can see which projects are lagging behind so that the government bodies get alarmed on what actions to take next.

**The problem it solves:**
* Data Transparency: The main problem with the administration of our country is that the data that are delivered from high level administrations to low level aren't transparent. There is always a blur lines that seperates the high officials who are so called the mayors or reputed posts of the community and the general people like us. A general survey in a municipality has shown that, the high officials always say that they have done the best for their community, but same questions when asked to general public, they tell that they are still stucked in the general base level problems like lack of safe drinking water and power outage. These are the most common problems a typical neplease citizen face.

* continious manual update on data: The trend that has rooted the neplease administration is that once a work is finished then it goes in the trash. It may be used further or not. This problem must be overcomed so that the data are fresh and decisions and actions also reflect present problems and help the decision makers solve them.

* providing insights of actual condition of real life: one of the major problems is that the so called high officials like mayors or prime ministers don't see the problems and challenges in the way the general people see. So, in these cases its our duty to let them see what the problems are clearly in the canvas so that whenever they turn on the screen or use technology, they would see them and that problem would be their first priority and it will help sole these problems in a proper way.

* keep track of survey report: the report once comes as output of any survey must be used and stored for further purposes, they are useful in future references to solve many similar problems. this will help solve time of the analyst as well as the problems solvers.

* Awaring the governmental officials on the projects which they are lagging behind at. the governmental officials always deny without factual data.

### eHealth_Nepal
--------------------------------------

**Elevator Pitch:**
Our project is a web application that connects health institutions and individuals to provide updated health reports.

**The problem it solves:**
In Nepal, we barely have the services of digital health report. Most of the time, we lost our health report and never get it back. If we had our health report in a digitized way, it would not only help us know our health status but also to know future health services we might need. For eg: a hospital could update the vaccines that a patient has taken and also those that are in due. Our platform helps one achieve these goals. Every time, a person goes to the hospital, his online health portal is updated and can be used for easy-sharing, analyzing or for personal use. Overall, we just want to create a digital health diary that we could look upon anytime, anywhere!

### Factoid
--------------------------------------
**Elevator Pitch:**
Fact-checking the Internet with Crowd Intelligence

**The problem it solves:**
The thing about the Internet is that anyone can post content on it, it's a double-edged sword really. With the liberty of information, there is also a lot of misinformation. People are quite vulnerable to this, especially children with undeveloped judgement, older generation new to the Internet.

Our project aims to solve this issue to some extent. We have an ecosystem of tools and technologies that serves to ease people's daily Internet Content consumption, where fake and viral content are abound. We have a Web App and a Web Browser Extension that helps people evaluate the content on their screen in real time. This is the core featureset we have developed so far but the project actually has an extensive scope.

This platform will also help enhance Critical Thinking Skill as people get more and more aware of their Content Consumption while using our tools; it has a pedagogical value as well in this regard.

### Tour360
--------------------------------------
**Elevator Pitch:**
Experience your dream vacation from your home.

**The problem it solves:**
Virtual Reality has been around for a while now but we have not really seen its implementation in tourism in Nepal. Nepal has a huge potential in tourism but we are not receiving enough tourists. A part of it is because there is no dedicated platform for a wholesome travel experience. Travelers have to wander between flight booking sites, hotel booking sites, guide booking sites and more to plan a complete trip. Moreover, virtual reality, which can be crucial for deciding a travel destination, has not been implemented into a dedicated platform. This has affected the number of tourists that flow into our country.

### Hamro Waste
--------------------------------------
**Elevator Pitch:**
Nepal's Waste Portal

**The problem it solves:**
As we all know, the problem of waste management is very evident in Nepal. One of the major issues contributing to it is the information gap. There aren’t many websites in Nepal that are specifically dedicated in providing good quality content about waste management. Many Nepalese citizens are quite unaware about good sustainable practices. Filling that gap, HamroWaste aims to provide services like contemporary articles on waste issues, educational videos, waste calculator and the coverage of many events and trainings happening around. Our ultimate aim is to push Nepal near ‘Zero Waste’ through our web content.

**The problem it solves:**
With this platform we had aimed to solve problems that are there in the local level but are somewhat ignored in the community or the nation.Our product Junkiri solves two major problem that currently exists in the nation: 

1) Problem Regarding Health Care : We were somewhat shocked by the data our mentors from biz shared with us and we took on the challenge to built a platform that visualizes the data for the executive of the states to help them make development plan easily and in more efficient way. The app classifies the healthcare sectors in tow categories logistic regression model predicts whether the health care is unto the mark or not.

2) Water Scarcity : Water scarcity along with water waste is another problem that we looked to solve for this we analyzed rain data of past years and with user inputs such as rooftop type area we calculate the amount of water and money they save if they opt for rain water harvesting.

### MEDASSIST
--------------------------------------
**Elevator Pitch:**
Quick appointment with available Doctor and Lab Report retrieval and management through web

**The problem it solves:**
The issue it aims to solve is the wait time issue in hospitals where patients have to waste hours upon hours for a check up and at the same time it also tackles issues with lab reports and make things easier by allowing retrieval and storing of reports digitally on the web.

We know how hectic hospital queus can be. Rather than sitting on a cold metal chair staring at a gloomy environment, we can just make appointment to a doctor from the comfort of our home and just go for the checkup at the given time. No more gloomy waits for anyone. Wasting time is nobody's forte and waiting for a turn in a queue is not a good thing for a world as fast paced as we see it now. So this webapp tends to overcome this issue by allowing users to make easy appointments with a doctor. And get things done faster.

Similarly, Reports are another big hassle. It takes time and you never know when it will be ready. There must have been times for everyone of us where we went to grab our reports but we just had to leave back home empty handed cause nothing was ready yet. Also for sick patientes there are tons and tons of reports and its difficult to manage them all. As some reports may be very costly and losing them can be a big issue. This software allows users to retrieve reports through web as labs and users are directly conected. Also all the repots are saved in the web in a orderly fashion so one can grab it when he needs to.

Overall, this software tends to save time and health of patients.

### Glass Governance
--------------------------------------
**Elevator Pitch:**
Those who are in authority has responsibility to which they are accountable for

### Land Market
--------------------------------------
**Elevator Pitch:**
No middleman, transparent land transactions

**The problem it solves:**
Normally there is a middleman in between traders to manage the trade of land that may cost a huge commission and may also lead to fraud. Through our project of “Land Contract” built in blockchain, it eliminates the need of middleman and since blockchain is highly secure, no any hacking/ leaking of data can be done. Since, the blocks in the blockchain can’t be alternated, the history of the whole land, buyers and seller can be found out so that no third party can claim of its ownership.

### nepForm
--------------------------------------
**Elevator Pitch:**
A web application that will let students and parents apply to schools, high schools, and colleges of their choosing via online registration

**The problem it solves:**
nepForm is aimed at students to help them have easier access to a school or college's admission forms and processes. In this day and age, we are getting used to relying on technology to solve every kind of problem that we might come across. For students living a long way from their choice of college or school, traveling all that distance just to collect one piece of paper or just to have an understanding of what kinds of courses the institution offers can be tedious, exhausting and time-consuming, especially when the student is applying to multiple institutions. Through this application, students and parents alike can collect information about schools and colleges of their choice and fill out admission forms for as many schools or colleges as they would like instead of visiting the institution in real life to collect and fill out their admission forms, saving them time and making the whole process way less hectic and stressful. This application can be of even more help to those living outside the valley and wishing to attend an institution inside the valley. Instead of traveling all that way for a single piece of paper, they can now apply to as many schools and/or colleges as they would like and as far away from their homes as they want. The main goal of this application is to make the applying process a lot easier by having everything a student will need, in one place.

**Elevator Pitch:**
The project simplifies the shopping experience. The marts that implement this project, have customers who simply enter the mart, pick up his/her shopping goods and finally exits the mart skipping all.

**The problem it solves:**
At the present moment, shoppers tend to queue in order to pay their bills losing valuable time which gets only worse as the population explodes and the cost required to sustain a mart is high. Our product keeps the track of goods bought locally Our project skips the entire queue, bills the customers online automatically, allows customers to leave their wallets at home, reducing the risk of theft Challenges we ran into We struck by the dependencies of the deeplearning libraries of python and got struck in the evnironment error as well as dependicies which ultimately leads to kernel failure.As our platform is both web and app, with the implementation of neural nets and IOT devices, it was really tough to implement those all together.
